Machine Learning -
    The basic process of machine learning is to give training data to a learning algorithm. The learning algorithm then generates     a new set of rules, based on inferences from the data. This is in essence generating a new algorithm, formally referred to as     the machine learning model.
    
Common terms used -
    Labelled data:   It consists of a set of data, an example would include all the labelled cats or dogs images in a folder,                          all the prices of the house based on size etc.
    Classification:  Separating into groups having definite values Eg. 0 or 1, cat or dog or orange etc.
    Regression:      Estimating the most probable values or relationship among variables. Eg. estimation of the price of the house                      based on size.
    Association:     Discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases where the connection found is crucial.

Types Of Machine Learning -
    Supervised Learning:       The outcome or output for the given input is known before itself.
    Unsupervised Learning:     The outcome or output for the given inputs is unknown.
    Semi-supervised Learning:  It is in-between that of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
    Reinforced Learning:       The machine is exposed to an environment where it gets trained by trial and error method.
